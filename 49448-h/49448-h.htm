<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is nothing that is much more fun than
a party, is there? Mother hasn’t forgotten the
days when she set a little table in the attic with
the dolls’ tea-set, and had cambric tea and jam
sandwiches. As for a birthday party, why it
doesn’t seem a bit like a birthday without a
frosted cake and pink candles and ice cream in
forms—but there! That was to be a surprise.</p>

<p>Birthday parties only come once a year, of
course, but there are other parties in between,
afternoon teas on the piazza or in the playroom,
or in the barn, if you are so fortunate as to have
a barn. These parties oughtn’t to mean extra
work for mother, for you can have them all
yourself, if mother is willing.</p>

<p>So when she says, “Yes, you may have a
party,” after you have hugged her, and told her
she was the dearest mother in the world, you can
begin to get ready.</p>

<h2>INVITATIONS</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">First</span> of all, for the invitations. Choose your
prettiest note paper, and don’t forget to write
very plainly the date of the party. If you are
just going to have a little afternoon tea, you can
simply write,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Dear Daisy</span>,—</div>

<p>“<i>Will you come to my house to tea on Friday
afternoon, June sixth, at three o’ clock? I hope
you can.</i></p>

<p class="sig">
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">“<i>Lovingly</i>,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.<br />
</p>

<div class="unindent">
“<i>19 Elm Street.</i><br />
“<i>June first.</i>”<br />
</div></div>

<p>Or if you are going to have a larger party, you
can write:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Miss Dorothy Manners requests the pleasure
of your presence at her home on Friday afternoon,
June sixth, from four until eight o’clock.</i></p>

<div class="unindent">
“<i>19 Elm Street.</i><br />
“<i>June first.</i>”<br />
</div></div>

<p>Be sure to send your invitations in time for
your friends to write replies. Mother will need
to know just how large a birthday cake to bake,
and how much ice cream to freeze!</p>

<h2>GETTING READY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">If</span> you are going to have many parties, there
are quite a number of things which you can keep
on hand, all ready to use when you need them.
An old trunk or box, or barrel will be nice to
have on purpose for “dress-up” clothes. Put
away in this all the old hats, and dresses, and
shawls, in which mother lets you dress up. Then
they’ll be safe, so that no one will throw or give
them away by mistake, and you’ll always know
just where to find them.</p>

<p>It is a good thing to have wooden picnic plates
on hand, and these will be very useful for outdoor
parties. Mother may object to your using
her good china, for sometimes plates will get
broken when you are just as careful as you know
how to be. So you can decorate your wooden
plates very prettily by cutting out the flowers or
figures which are on paper napkins, and pasting
them on the plates. Then they will do nicely for
your lawn or piazza parties.</p>

<p>It is a good plan to have a supply of paper
napkins and you can buy them by the hundred,
or by the dozen. If mother is afraid to let you
have her pretty table cloth or lunch cloth for
fear it might get stained, you can get a lovely
paper table cloth with napkins and little dishes,
for twenty-five cents.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>You might suggest to your relatives when
Christmas or your birthday is near, that a set
of tea cups, or plates, or little spoons would be
a very acceptable present.</p>

<p>A folding table is very useful when you have
afternoon teas on the piazza or lawn, and this
can be bought for a dollar.</p>

<p>You can make very dainty baskets for candy
and salted nuts, from little paper cases costing
fifteen cents a dozen, and crepe paper at ten
cents a roll. Five or ten cents will buy a pretty
souvenir, and every child enjoys something to
take home from the party.</p>

<p>So you see a party isn’t such a great deal of
trouble, and I’m sure the “best mother in the
world” will let you invite your friends to come
and see you quite often.</p>

<h2>PARTIES YOU CAN HAVE WITHOUT MOTHER’S HELP</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Usually</span>, when mother’s friends call on her in
the afternoon, she serves them with tea and
wafers or cakes. Perhaps she lets you help her.
Now when your friends come to see you, very
likely mother will sometimes be willing for you
to make a pitcher of lemonade, or a few jam sandwiches,
for them. Try to serve these very daintily
on a tray, using the napkins which you have
all ready.</p>

<p>Here is a very valuable secret. When mother
says, “No, I can’t let you get your refreshments
ready yourself,” do you know the reason? She
is afraid you will not do it tidily, and that she
will have to set the kitchen in order after you
have finished. So put the sugar box back in its
place, don’t leave the breadboard out, and set
everything back just where you found it.</p>

<p>Then I’m sure that the next time you ask
mother she will say, “Yes.”</p>

<p>So if she allows you to make lemonade, or
cocoa for your friends, here are the recipes:</p>

<p>For one glass of lemonade take the juice of
half a lemon, mix with two teaspoons of sugar,
and add one cup of water. To make fruit lemonade
add a few strawberries, or cherries, or bits
of pineapple, or slices of orange to the lemonade.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>For one cup of cocoa, mix a teaspoon of cocoa
with a teaspoon of sugar, and then mix with one
tablespoon of boiling water. Stir it well till the
lumps are all out. Put a half pint of milk over
the stove (being careful not to burn it), when it
“wrinkles” on the top, pour the cocoa in, and
let it boil a few minutes, stirring so that it will
not scorch.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>FOR SANDWICHES</h2>




<p><span class="smcap">Soften</span> the butter a few minutes before you use
it. Butter the bread before cutting off each
slice, and cut very thin. Then lay the buttered
slices neatly together and trim off the crusts.
The sandwiches may be filled with jelly, jam,
chopped hard boiled egg, chopped meat, or nuts.</p>


<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2>CANDY PULL</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> course you must have this party in the
kitchen, and either ask your friends to bring
gingham aprons, or provide aprons for them.
Have nice bright tin pans ready for your candy,
and get together everything that the recipe calls
for. If mother is willing you can make two
kinds of candy at once on the stove, one for
“pulling” and one for “nut taffy.” Although
you can easily make the candy yourself, mother
had best be on hand when you are working over
the fire. This is a good party for a rainy day.</p>

<h2>FUDGE PARTY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a fudge party, you will need aprons of
course, and permission to use the stove, or perhaps
your big sister’s chafing dish. Get your
materials together, and when your friends come,
you can have just as good a time as the girls do
at college. “When Mother Lets Us Cook” will
tell you just how to make your fudge, and then
you will have one less thing to learn at college.</p>

<p>This is a good party for a rainy day.</p>

<h2>POP CORN PARTY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> this you will need popping corn, and several
poppers. If you only have one, maybe your
guests will bring theirs.</p>

<p>You can take turns rubbing the corn from the
ears, and popping it.</p>

<p>This is another rainy day party.</p>

<h2>SEWING BEE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Mother</span> will approve of a sewing bee, you see
if she doesn’t! It is a most industrious way to
spend an afternoon! Invite your friends
around, and ask them to bring their dolls, their
work baskets, and material to work with. (Of
course this is just a girls’ party! Boys are left
out!) If it is warm weather, it will be pleasant
to sew on the piazza or lawn, and if it is too cool
for this, the playroom will be pleasant for your
sewing bee. Of course the boys will say that
you do more talking than sewing, but show them
that they are wrong by getting some pretty
clothes made for your dolls.</p>

<p>At the end of the afternoon clear off your sewing
table, cover it with a dainty cloth and serve
afternoon tea. (It is queer to call it tea, when
you have cocoa or lemonade!)</p>

<h2>PAPER DOLL PARTY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> this party you will need as many paper
dolls as you have invited friends, and of course
this, too, is just a girls’ party. Boys are out of
it! Beside the dolls, get colored tissue or crepe
paper, scissors, and paste. Arrange a table, at
which to work, and when all your guests have
come, you can begin dressing the paper dolls.
Let each choose her own materials for the
dresses. If you like, you can give a prize for the
best dressed doll, mother to be the judge.</p>

<p>Then for refreshments lemonade, or cocoa and
sandwiches will be nice, or if mother is willing,
ice cream and cake. The refreshments can be
served on the table, on which you are working,
if you like, for it will only take a few moments
to clear away the work, and arrange it for a tea
table.</p>

<h2>CLOTHES PIN PARTY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a Clothespin Party you will need a couple
of dozen clothespins, and plenty of colored tissue
or crepe paper. In one corner of the invitation
you can draw a clothespin. The clothespin party
is very much like the paper doll party, except
that you dress clothespins up for dolls, in the colored
paper. You will be surprised to see what
pretty dolls you can make. Mother can decide
who has dressed the prettiest dolls, and give a
little prize. Your friends will enjoy playing
with the dolls they have dressed, until it is time
for refreshments. You can serve “afternoon
tea,” or something more if mother is willing.</p>

<h2>INDOOR GARDEN PARTY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> the indoor garden party, you will need a
large sheet for a screen, and plenty of pictures
cut from magazines and catalogues. These pictures
must be of houses, barns, stables, trees,
animals, anything that will have place in an outdoor
scene. You will also need a paper of pins,
some large sheets of white paper, and, if you like,
a couple of little gifts for prizes, such as a box
of crayons or a box of paints.</p>

<p>After your friends have come, arrange the
sheet in place, and pin in the center a large
picture of a house which has been cut out. Now
let your guests help themselves to the pictures
which you have cut out, each taking one. For
example, one child may have a barn, another a
rose bush, another a dog kennel. Blindfold each
in turn, and let him pin the picture on the sheet.
When all have finished you will have a queer-looking
landscape, for a dog kennel may be on
the roof and a rose bush growing from a lawn
mower!</p>

<p>After this game, get out your sheets of paper,
scissors, and pictures which you have ready. Let
each one try making a garden with his eyes open!
Paste a house in the center of the paper, and
arrange trees, bushes, fountain, etc., about it as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
tastefully as possible. Then after mother has
decided which is the best, you can give the prize
which you have bought.</p>

<p>You can serve your refreshments from a little
table just as you would at a garden party.</p>

<h2>CHRISTMAS SUNSHINE PARTY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is really the very nicest kind of a party
to give. Just try it and see for yourself! For
this you will need plenty of narrow, red (or red
and green ribbon) holly seals, nice white wrapping
paper, and any other things which make
holiday packages look “Christmas-y.” Be sure
not to forget a jar of paste. Buy some of the
beautiful copies of famous paintings, which are
sold at a cent a piece, and cards on which to
mount them, at two cents each. If mother can
let you have some colored cambric-pink or
blue-you can use it for scrap-books, and you
will also need scrap pictures and plenty of old
magazines from which to cut pictures. Have
ready a couple of dozen holly napkins, and three
pounds of candy.</p>

<p>Write your invitations on paper with a holly
decoration in the corner, and ask your friends
to bring any toys which they are willing to give
away.</p>

<p>Then when the children come there will be
plenty to do. Two can cut scrap pictures from
the magazines, another can make the scrap book
from the pink or blue cambric.</p>

<p>The pictures will need to be mounted, and when
you do these, just paste the corners to the mount.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
They must be wrapped prettily in white paper,
and either sealed with holly seals or tied with
ribbon, or both. These are nice gifts for a hospital.</p>

<p>Two other children can attend to the candy
bags. Lay a holly napkin right side up on the
table and put a handful of candy in the center.
Now draw the corners together, and tie firmly
with ribbon, around the candy. Smooth out the
corners, and you will have a pretty candy bag.</p>

<p>The toys which have been brought will need
to be wrapped nicely and tied with ribbon, so the
afternoon will pass quickly. Perhaps mother
will let you serve creamed chicken, peas, potato
chips, ice cream and cake to your guests, for after
such a busy afternoon they will surely be hungry.</p>

<p>This is a very good way to entertain your Sunday
school class.</p>

<h2>EASTER SUNSHINE PARTY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is very much like a Christmas Sunshine
Party, except that you will need a number of
little baskets, candy Easter eggs, lavender or yellow
ribbon, lily or violet napkins, and little
chickens or rabbits which you can buy for a cent
a piece.</p>

<p>Then you can make little Easter gifts for other
children and have a good time while you are
doing it. Tie up the candy in the Easter napkins
just as you did in the Christmas napkins,
and let the children arrange pretty Easter
baskets.</p>

<p>This is a good party to give to your Sunday
school class, and your teacher.</p>

<h2>DOLL’S CHRISTMAS TREE PARTY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is also a Christmas holiday party. For
this you will need either small evergreen
branches for the Christmas tree, or better yet, the
little dwarf trees in pots. Ask mother to let you
have some of the ornaments from your own tree,
and have plenty of colored paper, paste, scissors,
also popcorn, needles and thread, and tree hooks.
If you can have a little netting, some colored
worsted, and candy, you can find use for them.
After your friends have come, make the ornaments
for your trees, such as gilt and silver
stars, strings of popcorn, and chains of colored
paper. Using a doll’s stocking as a pattern, cut
the net in the shape of stockings, overhand two
pieces together with colored worsted on three
sides. Fill these bags with candy, then overhand
the top together and hang on the tree.</p>

<p>Hot chocolate with sandwiches is nice for a
winter afternoon, and your friends will enjoy it
after they have finished trimming their trees.</p>

<h2>A CHRISTMAS SEWING BEE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A Christmas</span> sewing bee is very much like any
other sewing bee, except that instead of making
dolls’ clothes, you make Christmas presents.
Ask the other girls to bring whatever gifts they
are working on, and you can spend a busy afternoon
together. Christmas time always comes
more quickly than you think it will, and it is a
good plan to have your presents ready early. So
I’m sure mother will approve of a Christmas

<h2>INDOOR PICNIC</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is a nice party to give during Christmas
week, when the Christmas greens are still up, and
you have so many new toys that you want to
show your friends. For this party you will need
evergreens, an old covering like a “drugget” for
the floor, large baskets, wooden plates, and refreshments
such as you have at a picnic.</p>

<p>Before the children come, fill the baskets with
sandwiches, devilled eggs, cookies, fruit, and
cake, and whatever else you like to take when
you go on a picnic.</p>

<p>Trim the playroom with greens, and cover the
floor, so the picnic won’t hurt it. When your
guests arrive, you can play outdoor games, just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
as if you were at a real picnic. When it is time
for refreshments, the children can help you bring
in the baskets, and can set the table in true picnic
style. Instead of a pitcher of water, use a pail
and dipper, and if you have lemonade, that
should be in a pail, too.</p>

<p>You will find that an indoor picnic is a great
deal of fun.</p>

to let the dolls play too roughly, for they might

<h2>AN AFTERNOON IN HOLLAND</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is a party which your friends will be sure
to enjoy. Write your invitations on paper decorated
with Delft scenes, or else upon cards cut
in the shape of a Dutch shoe. Ask mother to
please make you a Dutch cap of lawn, and then
with a red or blue dress and a kerchief you’ll be
a young Hollander. Have ready as many Dutch
post cards as you have invited guests, also scissors,
and a wooden shoe apiece.</p>

<p>First play “Going to Amsterdam,” which is
the same as your old friend “Going to Jerusalem.”
Then while your guests catch their breath
after this very exciting trip, bring out your
Dutch post cards and give one to each child, with
a pair of scissors and an envelope. The post
cards must all be cut into irregular pieces for
puzzles, and then the pieces put in the envelope,
being careful not to lose a single piece. When
all the puzzles are cut, let each child pass to his
right-hand neighbor. Then allow five minutes
to put the puzzles together, after which you pass
puzzles again. If you have not invited many
guests, you can keep on passing puzzles till you
have solved them all.</p>

<p>Now for the game of “Wise Men,” which is
really a German game, but will do very well for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
a Dutch party. Choose three children for the
wise men. These three enter the room, and are
asked, “Who are you?” They answer, “Three
men traveling hither from the East.” Then
comes the question, “What kind of men are
you?”</p>

<p>“We are good, honest men.”</p>

<p>“What is your trade?”</p>

<p>The “wise men” must then go through the motions
of some trade, such as baking, ploughing,
building, etc. The others must guess the occupation
meant, and as soon as they have guessed
three other wise men are chosen.</p>

<p>A more restful game is Dutch Housewife.</p>

<p>One child is chosen for “Housewife” and she
must ask contributions for her kitchen. So
each in turn offers to give some article used in
the kitchen, such as a stove, dishpan, plate, etc.
Then the “Housewife” must ask each player ten
questions, and to each question, the article contributed
must be given as the reply. Whoever
laughs must pay a forfeit. If you have promised
a dishpan, and the housewife asks, “In what
do you ride?” you must of course answer, “A
dishpan.” It’s hard not to laugh, and almost
everyone has to pay a forfeit.</p>

<p>The supper table can be set in Delft blue with
a small windmill for a centerpiece, and at each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
place have a wooden shoe, filled with chocolates.
Mother would be sure to say that a regular
“Dutch lunch” would mean a visit from the doctor
some hours later. So instead of pickles and
cheese, and all the other indigestibles that the
grown folks enjoy, serve chocolate with whipped
cream, sandwiches, chocolate bonbons, and honey
cakes. (These latter you can buy at any German
bakery.)</p>

<p>I’m sure your friends will all vote this “Afternoon
in Holland” a great success.</p>

<h2>JAPANESE TEA</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> may be given indoors or on the piazza,
according to the season of the year. Send your
invitations on note paper with a Japanese decoration
in the corner, and address each friend by
some Japanese name such as Wistaria, Chrysanthemum
or Cherry Blossom. If this is to be an
indoor tea, arrange one room to look as much
like Japan as possible, and this can be done by
taking the furniture out! Place straw mats on
the floor to be used for chairs. Little bamboo
plant stands, and footstools will do very well
for tables, and a few plants will decorate the
room nicely. Maple branches at the doorways
or artificial cherry boughs will give a very festive
air.</p>

<p>Japanese costumes can be easily managed.
All you need is a kimona, wide sash, and a few
little fans for your hair. The sash should be
tied under your arms with a “butterfly” bow
in the back, and your hair should be dressed high,
and ornamented with tiny fans. If you haven’t
a kimona, borrow mother’s, and make a deep hem
in it, so that it will be the right length.</p>

<p>If you want to be very “Japanese,” your
friends can remove their shoes at the door of
the room. They must address you very respectfully,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and speak of your “magnificent home,”
while you, according to Japanese rules of politeness,
should thank them for coming to your miserable
hut!</p>

<p>Have a few checker-boards, and a game of
Halma in readiness, for checkers and backgammon
are Japanese games, while Halma is very
much like a game which represents the fifty-three
post stations between Yedo and Kioto.
Call the starting place “Yedo,” and your goal
“Kioto” and you have almost exactly a Japanese
game. Charades are favorite amusements of
Japanese children, and so is a game like our
“Authors.”</p>

<p>It would be very interesting if mother would
read aloud a Japanese fairy story, for you would
all enjoy it.</p>

<p>Refreshments should be brought in on a lacquer
tray and served on the low stools, and of
course you will need Japanese dishes. Tea,
dainty little cakes and bonbons would be a good
choice for refreshments, but it would be an excellent
plan to set a plate of sandwiches on your
tray, too, for the Japanese menu might not be
sufficient for an American appetite.</p>

<h2>JAPANESE TEA (Outdoors)</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a Japanese Tea on the lawn you will need
the same costumes as for an indoor tea. The refreshments,
too, are the same, and the piazza
can be easily arranged in Japanese style.</p>

<p>If you are fortunate enough to have plenty
of room for your party, a kite-playing contest
will be great fun, and you must be sure to get
the queer “bird” kites that the children of Japan
love. Puss-in-the-corner is a Japanese game
(did you know it before?) and so is Blindman’s
Buff.</p>

<p>Japanese girls and boys enjoy battledore and
shuttlecock, and when they play, whoever fails
must have his face marked with charcoal.</p>

<p>The Japanese children are fond of playing
ball, too, and they use a ball wound with silk
of different colors.</p>

<p>By the time that you have tried all these games,
you and your guests will be quite ready to sit
down on the straw mats, and enjoy Japanese
refreshments.</p>

<h2>HIAWATHA PARTY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is a party for the country, and though
it sounds like a boys’ party, the girls will enjoy
it, too.</p>

<p>For this you will need a target, one of the
new guns which shoots rubber-tipped arrows,
several boxes of beads, a set of quoits, boomerangs
(which you can buy for twenty-five cents
at a toy store), a football, and a number of prizes.
These may be Indian baskets, birch bark canoes,
or anything that is Indian. For your costume
you can buy a “Hiawatha” or “Minnehaha” suit
from a dollar up, or for twenty-five cents you
can get a kind of Indian apron which is stamped
on muslin, all ready to cut out. Write your
invitations on birch bark, with your pyrography
set (if you have one), and ask your friends
to wear Indian costumes and to take an Indian
name for the occasion.</p>

<p>A Hiawatha Party should be a field day of
outdoor sports, so arrange a program of races,
(obstacle and hurdle races would be fun) and
have a prize for each winner. Quoits is an Indian
game, or at least, the Indians play a game
very much like our quoits, and when your guests
are tired of this, set up your target for an archery
contest. The girls will enjoy making bead necklaces,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and if they have brought their dolls, each
doll must be strapped to a board in “papoose”
style, and be fastened to her “mother’s” shoulders.</p>

<p>Indians are fond of football, although they
don’t play by rules, for they simply kick the
ball about, and each tries to keep it as long as
possible.</p>

<p>Boomerangs are very fascinating toys, which
will sail through the air, circle around the object
you aimed at, and come back to you.</p>

<p>When the braves and squaws have grown hungry,

which the “tribe” probably prefers to venison,
and with it are passed hot cornbread and ears
of corn. Berries may be served in birch bark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a><br /><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>

<h2>DAFFODIL PARTY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Plenty</span> of “daffy-down-dillies” will be used
for this party, also materials for making them
of paper (you can buy this already prepared),
brown tissue paper, yellow and green crepe paper,
clothes pins, yellow baby ribbon, and as many
little gifts as you have invited guests. Get a
shallow wooden box about two feet long and one
foot wide and fill it with sawdust. Wrap your
gifts in the brown tissue paper, so that they will
look like bulbs. Now fasten each to the stem of
a daffodil (you may use paper daffodils if you
wish) and “plant” them in your box of sawdust.
When you have finished, your box will look like a
bed of daffodils, especially if you cover the outside
of the box with green paper. Arrange vases
of daffodils around the room, or piazza. It
would be a very good idea for you to wear yellow
sash and ribbons with your white dress. Then
you’ll be a “daffy-down-dilly” yourself! After
your friends have come you can give each one materials
for a paper daffodil, and whoever makes
the prettiest, should receive a little prize. Next
you can dress “daffy-down-dilly” dolls, using
clothes pins, and the crepe paper, and of course
the one whose doll is the best should have some
reward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>After you have played whatever games your
guests will enjoy the best, lead the way to the
fairy daffodil bed, which is, of course, your
wooden box. Then let each pull out a daffodil,
and find the surprise hidden at the root.</p>

<p>Mother will probably decorate the table in
yellow for you, and of course in the center will
be a big bowl of daffodils. Chicken salad, potato
chips, rolls, frozen custard, cakes with
orange icing, and salted nuts, would be a very
good choice for refreshments, as they would carry
out the yellow plan. It would be an excellent
idea to give each one of your guests a few daffodils
to take home.</p>

<h2>BUTTERCUP PARTY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is just the party for the country when
the buttercups seem to be nodding their yellow
heads to you and saying, “Come and pick us!”</p>

<p>The invitations for this party may be neatly
printed with gilt paint upon a white card, or else
written on note paper which has a buttercup
decoration.</p>

<p>You will need to have ready a number of little
yellow baskets—as many as you have invited
children—two or three pounds of “buttercup”
candies, and a sheet on which mother has drawn
in yellow crayon, a large buttercup without any
stem. Cut out of pasteboard or cloth a stem to
fit this buttercup.</p>

<p>It would be a good idea for you to wear a
white dress with yellow sash and hair ribbons.</p>

<p>After your guests have come, first of all you
can have a buttercup hunt. Give each child a
yellow basket in which to collect candy buttercups.
Mother has hidden the buttercups for
you, having first wrapped each in paraffine paper.
(They would be sticky if she didn’t do
this!) After you have filled your baskets, and
if you choose, have given a prize to the one collecting
the most buttercups, you can announce a
buttercup contest. This is exactly like a donkey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
party, except that the blindfolded one must pin
the stem on the buttercup. It isn’t as easy as
it would seem!</p>

<p>Next you can play “Buttercups and Farmer.”
This is a form of blindman’s buff, for the
“farmer” must be blindfolded. Take a space
on the lawn about twenty feet square for the
“field” and place the “farmer” in the center.
The “buttercups” (who are the rest of the children)
may take their places anywhere in the
field. When ready to begin, the farmer says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The buttercups are in my way,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I’ll mow them down when I make hay.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="unindent">He is then allowed to take eight steps, while the
buttercups must not move. If he touches a buttercup,
and names the child who is the buttercup,
that one becomes farmer. If the farmer
fails to touch a buttercup he must be led back
to the center of the field again.</p>

<p>When it is time for refreshments, the table
can be set out under the trees, and if mother is
willing, your girl friends will enjoy decorating
it with buttercups. For refreshments you can
serve chicken sandwiches, lemonade, little cakes
iced with orange icing, and ice cream in yellow
paper cases. A little girl who gave this party
said that it was a great deal of fun.</p>

<h2>TULIP TEA</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> tulips are the national flower of Holland,
a tulip tea is only another form of a Dutch party.
The Dutch games may be played, and for a surprise,
a tulip bed should be arranged, just as the
daffodil bed was.</p>

<p>The same refreshments may be served at your
“Tulip Tea,” as you had for your afternoon in
Holland, but your table decorations will need to
be different. The very prettiest centerpiece you
can have would be gay red and yellow tulips
in a Japanese flower-holder. If you do not own
one of these latter, give one to mother for her
birthday, for they do not cost much, and are
much prettier for flowers than a vase.</p>

<p>The candles should have red and yellow shades,
and a little “tulip” lamp should stand at each
place as a souvenir to take home.</p>

<h2>CLOVER PARTY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> you have near your house a clover
patch where four-leaved clovers are whispering
“Come and find me!” Then of course you must
have a clover party! Press as many clover
leaves as you have invited guests, and decorate
each invitation card with one of the pressed
leaves. Write the invitations in green ink.
There isn’t a great deal to get ready for this
party. Ask mother for a sheet, and either you
or she can draw in green crayon a large, four-leaved
clover. Cut from green cardboard four
leaves which will exactly fit this outline. Have
ready a large paper bag filled with nuts and
candy, a stick twined with green paper for a
wand, and as many green baskets as you have
invited children. Do not forget to have several
“clover” pins, to use for prizes.</p>

<p>After everyone has come, you can announce
a four-leaved clover hunt, and reward the lucky
finder with the clover pin, as a prize.</p>

<p>Next comes the clover contest, which is almost
the same as the famous “Donkey Party.” Fasten
up between two trees the sheet upon which
the four-leaved clover has been drawn. Blindfold
each child in turn, giving him the four
clover leaves to pin in place, and give a prize to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the one who has come nearest to the right places.</p>

<p>“Bees in Clover” is a lively game which all
will enjoy. Mark off a line by means of string,
which shall be the boundary of the “clover
patch.” The farmer stands in the clover patch,
and tries to keep the bees (the other children),
out of his clover. As soon as a bee crosses the
line, the farmer tries to touch him, and if he
succeeds, the bee must stay and help him catch
the others.</p>

<p>When you are tired of this game, ask mother
to hang the bag of nuts and candy high up,
where you can reach it with the wand, and give
each child a basket. Now blindfold each in turn,
and let him try to be the “lucky” one who will
strike the bag with the wand and break it. When
the bag is broken the candy and nuts will come
tumbling down, and then there will be a general
scramble to gather them and fill the baskets.</p>

<p>Refreshments should be served on the lawn
or piazza, and the table should be prettily decorated
with clover blossoms. The refreshments
may be tongue and lettuce sandwiches, grape lemonade,
cakes with pink icing and cherry ice. It
would be a good idea to serve the sandwiches
from picnic plates decorated with clover.</p>

<h2>ROSE PARTY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> June, when the roses are blooming in the
garden, or climbing over the piazza, you must
be sure to have a rose party! Give it on the
lawn, if you are fortunate enough to have one,
or else on the piazza.</p>

<p>If you do not mail your invitations but have
them left at your friends’ homes, tie each note
with pink ribbon to the stem of a pink rose.</p>

<p>For your party you will need to have ready
“Rose Ring Toss.” If you have a set of “ring
toss,” wind the hoops with pink paper, and if
you have not a set, you can easily make one,
by winding different size embroidery hoops with
pink paper, and driving a stake in the ground
where you are ready to play. Have ready, also,
a number of pink bean bags.</p>

<p>The first game to play is “Drop the Rose,”
which is just like “Drop the Handkerchief,” except
that you use a long-stemmed pink rose (be
sure and trim the thorns off!).</p>

<p>This can be followed by “Rose Ring Toss,”
and of course you know that this is played by
standing some distance from the stake, and trying
to throw the rings over it. The large ring
counts five, the next ten, and the next fifteen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Mother will keep score for you, and she can
decide what number will win the game.</p>

<p>A party wouldn’t be complete without “London
Bridge!” But as this is a rose party the
“pillars” of the bridge can offer each child the
choice between a red rose or a pink rose. Next
you can enjoy a game of bean bag.</p>

<p>By this time you will be ready for refreshments,
and mother will not have any difficulty
in decorating the table, with plenty of roses at
hand. In the center of the table should be a
“Jack Horner” pie, in the form of a large paper
rose, and from this “pie,” pink ribbons run to
each place. (A Jack Horner pie can be bought,
all ready to set on the table.) Little candy boxes
with a rose decoration will be just the thing for
souvenirs to take home. For refreshments have
creamed chicken, or chicken salad, rolls, small
cakes iced in pink, salted nuts, pink bonbons,
and strawberry ice cream. To serve the ice
cream in a very pretty way, take small flower
pots, and scrub them well, till they are as clean
as clean can be. Then they can be filled with
strawberry ice cream. Next, chocolate is grated,
on the top, until the pink is covered and it looks
like a little pot of earth. Now stick a pink rose
in it, as if the rose were growing in the pot, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
you will have a “dainty dish to set before a
king!”</p>

<p>After you have finished, when mother gives
the signal, pull the pink ribbons and out from
the Jack Horner pie will come a present for
each of you.</p>

<h2>DAISY PARTY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the fields are full of daisies, and they
are growing in the parks, too, ask mother to allow
you to go and gather some, and then you’ll be
ready for a daisy party. Of course this is an
outdoor party!</p>

<p>When you write your invitations, sketch a
daisy in the corner (a daisy isn’t hard to draw!)
and color it with your crayons. For your party
you will need a sheet like you had for your buttercup
party, except that a daisy is drawn, instead
of a buttercup. Daisy ring toss is like
rose ring toss, too, except that the rings are
wound with yellow and white paper. You will
need, also, some little gift, as a prize for the
one who pins the stem to the daisy. If you like,
you can make a few yellow and white bean bags.</p>

<p>It will not be hard to entertain your friends
at the daisy party. “Drop the Daisy” is a lively
game like “Drop the Handkerchief.” Daisy
ring toss will be a great deal of fun, and every
one will enjoy trying to pin the stem to the daisy.
You can have a merry game with the yellow and
white bean bags, and then will be ready for refreshments.
If your guests are girls, they will
enjoy helping you decorate the table with daisies,
but perhaps mother will prefer to do it herself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>For supper, serve chicken salad, rolls, deviled
eggs, white and gold cake, and vanilla ice cream.
Have the ice cream cut in round slices (it should
be packed in a can for this) and in the center,
place a round of lemon jelly, to resemble the
center of the daisy.</p>

but if the weather is warm, very likely mother
would prefer that you gave it out doors. Mother
Nature’s green carpet isn’t easily spoiled. For
this party you will need gingham aprons, pipes,
bowls, soap, and small tables, as well as several
prizes. You can blow bubbles with a penny clay
pipe, but nowadays there are fascinating “bubble”
sets which cost twenty-five cents. With
these you can blow the most remarkable bubbles,
and with each set are directions for fancy
bubble blowing, which will keep you busy the
whole afternoon.</p>

<p>You can have contests, and give a prize for
the largest bubble, the one that lasts the longest,
the one that floats the highest, etc. Mother will
probably be willing to “umpire” and award the
prizes.</p>

<p>For refreshments, serve sandwiches, fruit lemonade,

<h2>VALENTINE PARTY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Valentine’s Day</span> is an ideal day for a party,
and if mother says “yes,” why, send out your
invitations right away. Use heart-shaped cards,
and seal the envelopes with tiny “heart” seals.
Of course your preparations for the party will
depend on how much money you have to spend,
but here are some ideas that have been tried,
and are a great deal of fun. When you are
sure of the number of guests, buy heart-shaped
boxes, large red cardboard hearts, gifts, and
make small red bags, enough for each child to
have one. Borrow mother’s scissors, a jar of
paste, and hunt up any old magazines or catalogues
that may be in the house. Place a gift
in each “heart” box, wrap each box up neatly,
and tie with scarlet ribbon. A few vases of
scarlet carnations, and strings of hearts looped
about, will give the room a very festive air.
Hide the candy hearts around the room, where
they will not be found too easily. If you wear
a red sash and hair ribbons with your white
dress, you will look like a real little Valentine
girl, all ready to receive your guests.</p>

<p>The first “number on the program” may be a
Heart Hunt, so give each child a red bag in
which to collect the hearts which he finds. Next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
comes a heart auction, and mother can be auctioneer
and sell at auction the heart-shaped
boxes. The “customers” bid with candy hearts
instead of money, and nobody can make more
than one purchase.</p>

<p>Then St. Valentine’s candle (which is a red
candle in a candlestick) may be lit, and placed
on a table. Each child, in turn, must be blindfolded
and stand ten paces away from the candle.
He turns around three times, takes ten steps
toward the candle, as he supposes, and then tries
to blow it out. The one who is successful in
this, will be very fortunate through the coming
year.</p>

<p>Next distribute the pasteboard hearts, and let
each guest write his or her name on them. Now
pass to the right-hand neighbor, who must decorate
the heart with pictures cut from catalogues
or magazines. For instance, Dorothy’s heart
will be ornamented with pictures of dogs, birds,
hair ribbons and candy, for these are Dorothy’s
favorites. Jack’s heart will be decorated with
pictures of automobiles, motor boats, guns, and
fishing tackle. Each heart is supposed to show
just what the owner is fond of.</p>

<p>Then supper can be served, and since it is
Valentine’s Day a “hearty” supper will be just
the thing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Red carnations and red-shaded candles make
a pretty decoration, or if mother is willing to
take more trouble, a Cupid may occupy the place
of honor in the center of the table. From his
bow, narrow red ribbons extend to silver cardboard
arrows, which are at each place, and serve
as “place cards.” “Coup jacques,” for the first
course, sound interesting and are as nice as they
sound. Fill sherbet glasses half full of small
pieces of pineapple, orange and banana, then
cover with cherry ice, smoothing the top over
carefully. Oysters in heart-shaped pattie shells,
heart-shaped sandwiches, heart cakes, and bonbons,
and ice cream in the form of hearts, will
make a very nice Valentine supper, and there
should be a dainty Valentine souvenir at each
plate.</p>

<p>When your guests say “good-bye,” they’ll tell
you that they have had a lovely time. See if
they don’t!</p>

<h2>GEORGE WASHINGTON PARTY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Very</span> probably George Washington never had
a birthday party, as he lived in the days when
children were “seen and not heard.” So it
would be a good idea to have a party in his honor
on his birthday. Of course you will need old-fashioned
costumes, and these will probably be
found by ransacking the garret. But if, like
Mother Hubbard’s cupboard, the garret is bare,
you can easily borrow a skirt of mother’s, fasten
it under your arms, tie a sash in Empire style,
put on a kerchief, and there you are!</p>

<p>All that you will need to have ready for this
party will be silhouette paper, and cardboard
mounts for the silhouette pictures.</p>

<p>The afternoon may be spent in playing old-fashioned
games, such as “London Bridge,”
“What is my Thought Like,” “Proverbs,”
“Going to Jerusalem,” and “Mulberry Bush,”
ending up with a Virginia reel. Then while
you are resting, mother will make a silhouette
picture of each one of you. You must sit in
front of a lamp so that your shadow will fall
clearly upon the wall or door. Then the paper
should be fastened so that your shadow will fall
on it, and an outline be made with pencil. This
outline is to be cut out, and pasted upon a cardboard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
mount, and there is a fine silhouette portrait!
These portraits can be hung about the
room, as an art gallery, and you can have a great
deal of fun trying to decide “who’s who.”</p>

<p>By this time you will be ready for mother’s
old-fashioned supper, so you will sit down at
“early candle light,” and enjoy stewed chicken
and waffles, hot biscuit, preserves, cake and ice
cream. If mother wishes to be very “colonial”
she will have a large ball of popcorn in the center
of the table. A box of bonbons in the form of
a three-cornered hat, will be a nice souvenir for
each guest.</p>

<h2>ST. PATRICK’S PARTY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> St. Patrick’s Day draws near you will see
so many fascinating little souvenirs in the stores
that you really can’t help asking mother to let
you have a St. Patrick’s party. I hope she will
say “Yes!”</p>

<p>In the corner of your invitations should be a
shamrock or an Irish hat, and you can buy these
cards just before St. Patrick’s Day. For your
party you will need two pounds of candy “shamrocks,”
as many small baskets tied with green
ribbon as you have invited guests, a sheet upon
which a shamrock has been drawn (the one you
had for your clover party will do), and a smooth,
white stone, for the “Blarney Stone.” Beside
these have ready two dozen potatoes, a couple of
tablespoons, two shallow baskets and three
prizes.</p>

<p>Of course, before your friends arrive you must
pin a green bow on your dress, since this is the
day for “The Wearin’ of the Green.”</p>

<p>First comes the shamrock hunt, so give to
each child a bag or basket, and sharp eyes will
soon find the shamrocks which have been hidden
about the room.</p>

<p>Next, have the potato race in the hall, and of
course you know how to have a potato race!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Place the potatoes a foot apart in two long rows.
Let two children race first, and they must lift
the potatoes on a spoon, one by one, and carry
them back to the basket. Whoever drops one is
out of the race.</p>

<p>A box of candy decorated in green will be
a good prize for the winner.</p>

<p>As a rest from the excitement of the potato
race, the shamrock contest may come next, and
this is just like the clover contest at your clover
party.</p>

<p>Last of all, your friends must all kiss the
Blarney Stone, for of course you know that whoever
kisses the Blarney Stone will ever after say
nothing but pleasant words. Place the stone
(which you have had well scrubbed) in the center
of a table and blindfold each of your guests
in turn, and let them try to kiss it, and whoever
is successful will be fortunate ever after, as the
fairy tales say.</p>

<p>The supper table can be decorated very prettily
for a St. Patrick’s party with green-shaded
candles and ferns. After the lively games the
“company” will enjoy creamed chicken with
peas, potato chips (it wouldn’t be a St. Patrick’s
supper without potatoes!), cakes with pistachio
icing, green mint candy, and although
pistachio ice cream would carry out the green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
color plan, yet it would be better to have vanilla,
as there are many who do not care for pistachio.
It would be a good plan to have a little souvenir
at each plate.</p>

<h2>EASTER PARTY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> may be “Blue Mondays,” but surely
Easter Monday is one of the brightest, happiest
days that ever dawned. Of course you are anxious
for your friends to see the Easter gifts which
you have received, so if mother is willing, send
out your invitations for an Easter party, not
forgetting to seal them with a lily seal.</p>

<p>For your party you will need colored tissue
paper (as many different colors as you will have
guests), also a small basket apiece, and plenty
of little rabbits, chickens and eggs. Buy a couple
of pounds of jelly eggs, and have ready a
medium-sized, shallow basket. If this is a
“girls’” party, have ready eggshells from
which the egg has been blown, also scissors and
paste. Don’t forget a little gift for a prize, and
be sure to have for each guest an egg, upon which
his or her name is marked.</p>

<p>Before the children arrive, wrap the chickens,
rabbits and eggs separately in the colored tissue
paper, the same number in each color, and hide
them about the room. Hide the jelly eggs, too,
but of course these need not be wrapped.</p>

<p>Then you can begin your party with an “Easter
hunt.” Give each child a basket to gather
“treasures” in, but (this is important!) he can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
only keep articles wrapped in the color with
which his basket is tied. Of course with jelly
eggs, “finding’s keeping.” Next in order comes
“Tossing Eggs.” This sounds startling, but
jelly eggs won’t make any trouble. Place the
basket at one end of the room. Now, let each
child stand nine feet distant and try to throw
twelve jelly eggs into the basket. The one who
is the best marksman wins a prize.</p>

<p>A race with the small Easter eggs is “run”
just in the same way as a potato race, except
that teaspoons are used instead of tablespoons.</p>

<p>The girls will enjoy trying their millinery skill
by making tissue paper caps or bonnets for the
Easter eggshells, and mother can decide which
“egg lady” deserves a prize.</p>

<p>The supper table for the Easter party can be
made very pretty indeed. A hen on a nest will
be a good centerpiece, and scattered here and
there on the table place fluffy little ducks and
chickens. Your guests will greatly enjoy
creamed chicken with peas, deviled eggs, ice
cream in the form of lilies, or in lily paper cases,
bonbons and fancy cakes.</p>

<h2>RABBIT PARTY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Your</span> older sister will tell you that she knows
all about rabbit parties, and that for this festivity
you will require cheese and a chafing dish.
But she’s very much mistaken, even if she has
been to college. What you must have for your
rabbit party is a sheet with a rabbit drawn on
it, and a pair of cloth ears to pin on the rabbit.
You’ll also need a small candy rabbit, some modeling
clay (and aprons!) and three prizes, but
these are all, for this isn’t a college party.</p>

<p>Of course your invitations have been written
on paper which is decorated with a bunny.</p>

<p>Your first game can be the rabbit contest, and
for this let each child in turn be blindfolded and
try to pin the ears on the rabbit. A prize will
reward the one who pins them the nearest to
their proper place.</p>

<p>Next snip out with sharp scissors two small
holes for the rabbit’s eyes. Divide the children
into two groups, and let the first group go “behind
the scenes.” Then one after another can
look through the rabbit’s eyes, and the outside
group must try to guess who owns each pair of
eyes. It is harder than you would think. Then
the groups can change places, and the second
group be guessers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Next get out your modeling clay and aprons,
and the whole party can model rabbits. The
sculptor of the most life-like rabbit will of course
deserve a prize.</p>

<p>“Magic Music,” or “Rabbit Hunt,” is the next
game. Choose some one to leave the room.
Then hide the candy rabbit, and mother will begin
to play softly. The “hunter” must be
guided by the music, which is soft as he is far
from the hiding place, but grows loud when he
is near. If there is time before supper, the children
can “settle down,” while mother reads
aloud a “B’rer Rabbit” story.</p>

<p>“B’rer Rabbit” is king of the supper table,
too, for he sits proudly in the center, holding
pink ribbons like reins in his hands. These ribbons
run to each place and are fastened to whatever
souvenirs you have chosen to give your
friends. “Baby Bunting” dolls would be nice
for them.</p>

<p>For refreshments, serve sandwiches, rabbit
cookies, candy, salted nuts and ice cream in rabbit
forms.</p>

<h2>MAY DAY PARTY (Outdoors)</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> does seem as if May Day ought to be spent
in the woods and fields, under bright blue skies.
So if the weather man will be so very obliging
as to prophesy a mild May Day, why then let’s
off to the woods for a May Day party. Ask
your guests to bring baskets for gathering flowers,
and it would be a good plan to have a trowel
with you to dig up ferns and plants.</p>

<p>If you can have your May party near a brook,
a boat race would be a great deal of fun, and
you can provide boats for your guests. “Still
Pond” is a good game for a May party, and so
is “Puss in the Corner.”</p>

<p>Mother will pack up a picnic luncheon for
you, and the “first picnic” of the season will
surely be a success.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>MAY DAY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">May Day</span> always makes us think of a May
pole, and May dance, and a pretty queen crowned
with flowers. But May Day is apt to be chilly
and disagreeable, so you couldn’t very well think
of tripping around the May pole with your winter
coat and your overshoes on. But how about
a Sunshine May party for your Sunday-school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
class? If mother is willing, invite your teacher,
the girls (for this is a girls’ party. We’re sorry,
boys, but you really wouldn’t enjoy this!) Buy
some colored crepe paper and a couple of dozen
round paper cases such as are sold for fifteen
cents a dozen. Paste and scissors will be needed
also. When your friends come you can all busy
yourselves making May baskets from the crepe
paper and the paper cases.</p>

<p>When they are all finished they may be filled
with spring flowers and sent to a children’s hospital.
Wouldn’t you enjoy a pretty little basket
of flowers if you were sick?</p>

<p>Then it will be a simple matter to “clear up”
and set the table for afternoon tea. But perhaps
the “best mother that ever was” has decorated
the table in the dining-room with spring
flowers, and has prepared an appetizing supper
of creamed chicken, peas, potato chips, cake and
tutti-frutti jelly. That would be better, even,
than afternoon tea!</p>

<h2>FOURTH OF JULY PARTY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Mother</span> will highly approve of a Fourth of
July without fireworks, and when you ask to
have a Fourth of July lawn party she will be
quite sure to say “Yes.” If you haven’t note
paper with a firecracker in the corner, why, you
can get out your box of paints and do the decorating
yourself. A red firecracker isn’t hard
to draw and paint. For this party you will need
two dozen tiny flags (the paper ones will do
nicely), two tape measures, three shallow baskets,
of different sizes, three red, three white and
three blue bean bags, an archery set, with red,
white and blue target. Beside all these, have on
hand plenty of candy torpedoes, and as many red,
white and blue baskets as you have invited children.
Don’t forget to have several prizes ready.</p>

<p>An archery contest will be a great deal of fun,
and you can use a gun (instead of a bow) with
rubber-tipped arrows. Each circle in the target
counts a certain number of points, and mother
will probably consent to be score keeper.</p>

<p>Next comes a “soldier” game. Divide the
children into two companies, and let each company
stand in a row, facing the other, with a line
drawn on the ground between them. The first
row sing, to the tune of “Mulberry Bush,”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Soldiers are we who fight the foe,</div>
<div class="verse">Fight the foe, fight the foe,</div>
<div class="verse">Soldiers are we who fight the foe,</div>
<div class="verse">So early in the morning.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The second row sing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Who will you send to fight the foe,</div>
<div class="verse">Fight the foe, fight the foe,</div>
<div class="verse">Who will you send to fight the foe,</div>
<div class="verse">So early in the morning?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The first company answer:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">O, we’ll send Jimmy to fight the foe, etc.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The second company then sing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And we’ll send Tommy to capture him,</div>
<div class="verse">Capture him, capture him, etc.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Jimmy and Tommy join hands across the line
for a tug of war, and whichever one is pulled over
must join the enemy’s forces. At the end of
fifteen minutes the side which has the most “soldiers”
wins.</p>

<p>Next comes “bean bag toss.” Arrange the
three shallow baskets one inside the other, and
let each child stand ten feet distant. Now, he
must toss the bean bags into the baskets, and a
bag which falls in the center basket counts fifteen,
in the next, ten, and in the outer one, five.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Give a prize to the child who wins the most
points.</p>

<p>After this you can have a flag race. Choose
two of your guests and give each twelve flags and
a tape measure. The flags must be set in the
ground one foot apart, and the one who has his
row set out first wins. The children can run in
couples, then the winners should race, and the
victorious “flag planter” should be rewarded
with a prize.</p>

<p>Next you will all enjoy a torpedo hunt. Distribute
the baskets, and if you search in the
grass, and among the bushes, and on the piazza,
you will find torpedoes hidden. These won’t
“go off,” but, better yet, they are filled with
candy.</p>

<p>By this time you will be wondering if it isn’t
supper time, and, sure enough, mother appears
to lead the way. The table has been set in patriotic
style, with red, white and blue paper tablecloth
and napkins. At each place have a tall
“cannon cracker” filled with bonbons, and in the
center of the table may be a red, white and blue
“Jack Horner” pie. Tricolor ribbons run from
this to each place and are attached to a place
card. Serve sandwiches, ice cream, lemonade
and cake. After you have finished, draw your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
ribbons, and out of the pie will come a gift
wrapped in red, white or blue paper.</p>

<p>Mother may be tired from the “party,” but
she will be happier than if you had been playing
with firecrackers all day. Just ask her!</p>

<h2>HALLOWE’EN PARTY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> mother says that you are not old
enough to stay up late for a Hallowe’en frolic,
very likely she’ll let you have a party in the afternoon.
You can darken the rooms and have
just as good a time as if it were an evening party.
Now’s the time to go to your “dress-up” trunk
or barrel and get out all the treasures you have
put away there. Buy masks, so that each of
your friends will have one, for it wouldn’t be
Hallowe’en without “dressing up,” would it?</p>

<p>Have ready a rather shallow box (about six
inches deep) filled with sawdust, and in this box
bury a number of gifts—one for each child whom
you have invited. You will need a small shovel,
too.</p>

<p>Have ready also several quarts of peanuts,
plenty of red apples, and the favors which come
in the form of walnuts. These you can make
yourself, if you like, by cracking walnuts carefully
so that the halves will be perfect. Place
inside the shell one of the printed “fortunes,”
which you can buy, and glue the two halves of
the shell together. If you make the “magic”
walnuts yourself, only do one at a time, or else
you will have trouble putting the halves of the
shell together.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>When your friends arrive you can invite them
to “dress up” in the masks and clothes which you
have ready, and then you can have a jolly time
playing “Going to Jerusalem,” “Spin the Platter,”
“Magic Music” and others. Then all can
unmask.</p>

<p>Now invite your guests to sit down at small
tables, or they may all draw up before a large
table, and give each twenty peanuts, a saucer
and a long hat pin. When the signal is given,
each must spear the peanuts, one at a time, with
the hat pin, and put them in the saucer. This is
quite a good deal harder than it sounds. A
prize should reward the one who finishes first.</p>

<p>Next fill a tumbler with flour, press it down
tightly and turn it out in a mold. Stick a dime
(which you have washed) in the top of this mold
and set it on a small table. Form in line and
march around the table, and each in turn must
cut a slice from the mold, straight down.
Whosever slice makes the mold fall in, must lift
out the dime with his teeth.</p>

<p>Shadow pictures will be a great deal of fun.
Stretch a sheet across the room and divide the
company into two groups. Arrange a light so
that shadow pictures can be made on the screen.
Now let the first group go “behind the scenes,”
and one after the other pass between the light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a><br /><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
and the curtain. The audience must guess
“Who’s who,” so, of course, the others must try
to fix themselves up so that their shadows will
not be recognized. After all of the first group
have been guessed, the second group can be “actors.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 346px;">
<img src="images/i_083.jpg" width="346" height="500" alt="children gathered around tub of bobbing apples" />
<div class="caption">A Hallowe’en Party.</div>
</div>

<p>“Bobbing for apples” means a tub of water
and a great deal of splashing, so mother would
probably say “No.” Instead, hang the apples
on strings from the ceiling, and try to bite them,
while your hands are tied behind you.</p>

<p>When you are tired of this, announce a “Trip
to the Klondike.” Lead the way to your sawdust
box and let each in turn dig till he finds a gift
wrapped in yellow paper.</p>

<p>You’ll be ready for supper by this time, and
when you see the dining-room table you’ll say
“Oh!” Mother will have a yellow pumpkin
jack-o’-lantern in the center, and here and there
over the table she has placed little black cats,
and doll witches and brownies. The sandwiches
will be served on wooden plates decorated with
black cats. Beside these, she will have for you
gingerbread, cookies, nuts, fruits and nut candies.
Of course, she hasn’t forgotten the Hallowe’en
cake in which is baked a thimble, a new penny
and a ring.</p>

<p>Try this party and see what a good time you’ll
have.</p>

<h2>COLONIAL GARDEN PARTY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is a girls’ party, and perhaps your Sunday-school
class would enjoy giving it on the
church lawn. You will need quaint, old-fashioned
costumes, and very likely you can find them
in the attic, in great-grandmother’s trunk. Ask
mother to dress your hair high and powder it.</p>

<p>You and your classmates can serve old-time
refreshments, such as frozen custard and pound
cake, or “election” cake, fruit punch (which you
can make like fruit lemonade) and ices.</p>

<p>Arrange a program of old-fashioned music,
such as “Ben Bolt,” “Nancy Lee,” “Kathleen
Mavourneen,” “Blue Bells of Scotland,” and
others. Your musical friends will be glad to
help you, and your teacher will take charge of
the refreshments, while you and your classmates
serve the guests. You can probably make quite
a good deal of money by this party, especially
if there are summer hotels in your town.</p>

<h2>THANKSGIVING</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the Thanksgiving dinner, it will be a
good plan to have some lively games for the whole
family. Otherwise it’s more than likely that
you’ll get into some mischief, at least, the boys
will. So here are some games which you’ll all
enjoy:</p>

<p>First of all, suppose you try “It.” This is
just as foolish as it sounds, but it makes a great
deal of fun for all. Choose some person for “It.”
He must leave the room, and when he comes in
again, must do his best to make the others laugh.
They, on their part, try their best not to, for the
first who laughs becomes “It.” So the unfortunate
“It” dresses up in some queer style and
tries to win a smile from his audience, while they
watch him very gravely. It is discouraging, indeed.</p>

<p>Suddenly there will be a titter, a giggle and then
a burst of laughter from every one, and whoever
starts the laughter must change places with “It.”</p>

<p>Next try “Telegrams.” This calls for pencils
and paper. Give each player eight letters of the
alphabet. From these letters he must arrange
a telegram, each word of which must begin with
the given letter. For instance, if the letters “S
F M B H S A P” are given, the telegram<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
may be, “Send for mother. Billy has swallowed
a pin.”</p>

<p>Dumb Crambo is a good game for older people
as well as young folks. Divide the company
into two groups and let each choose a captain.
One group must remain in the room, while the
other goes out. The inside group decide on a
word of one syllable which can be acted. Perhaps
they choose “chat.” Then they tell the
others that the word rhymes with “bat.” The
second group tries to guess the word, but must
act out their guesses in pantomime. They may
try “hat” or “mat,” but not until they have
acted “chat” will the others applaud them.
Then the groups change places and the second
group becomes audience.</p>

<p>“Spin the Platter” is a lively game for
Thanksgiving afternoon. The players must
draw up their chairs in a circle, and each must
have a number, odd numbers for the boys and
even numbers for the girls. One child stands in
the center and spins a wooden plate or tray, calling
at the same time a number. The one whose
number is called jumps up and tries to catch the
platter before it has stopped spinning, and if he
fails to do this he must pay a forfeit.</p>

<p>Other games which you will enjoy playing on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Thanksgiving afternoon will be found in the
chapter on “Additional Games.”</p>

<p>So Thanksgiving afternoon, which you children
are apt to find rather long, will pass very
pleasantly, indeed.</p>

<h2>A HOLLY LUNCHEON</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Wouldn’t</span> it be lovely if mother let you give a
luncheon during the holidays? It would be quite
“grown up.” A holly luncheon would be just
the thing for Christmas week, and your friends
would enjoy seeing all your pretty Christmas
gifts. You can help mother decorate the table
with holly. Have a large bowl of it in the center
and a pretty spray at each place. Use holly napkins,
of course. Here is a good menu for you:</p>

<div class='center'>
Grape fruit (surrounded by holly sprays).<br />
Tomato soup.<br />
Breaded chops (with frill of red paper).<br />
Tomato sauce.     &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Peas.<br />
Potatoes.<br />
Vanilla ice cream (in form of snowballs).<br />
Red and green buttercups.   &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Fancy cakes.<br />

<h2>ADDITIONAL GAMES—MENAGERIE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A new</span> game which you will enjoy playing is
called “Menagerie.” Choose one of the children
for “keeper” and blindfold him. After he is
blindfolded, each of the others must choose the
name of some animal. The “animals” then
form a circle around the keeper and march about
him till he gives the order to “halt.” Then he
calls for an animal to come into the “cage” (the
circle), such as “bear.” The bear enters the
circle and, standing near the keeper, growls.
The keeper must guess the name of the child
who is the bear, and if he fails he must be keeper
again. If he guesses right the “bear” becomes
the keeper. Each child, when called into the circle,
must make the noise of the animal he represents.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>CRITICISM</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">To</span> play criticism, choose one of the children
to be criticised. Now let another child take pencil
and paper and ask each one to whisper something
about the child who was chosen, writing
the remark down so as to remember it. Then he
must read these sayings and the one who is criticised
must guess who said them. For instance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Jack has asked every one to say something about
Marjorie. When he has finished he turns to
Marjorie. “Some one says you have pretty
curls.” Marjorie guesses Edna.</p>

<p>Jack: “No, you are wrong. Some one says
your blue sash is lovely.”</p>

<p>Marjorie: “Grace said that.”</p>

<p>If Grace was the one she must take Marjorie’s
place.</p>

<p>Of course only pleasant things must be said
about each other.</p>

<h2>MUSICAL NEIGHBORS</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is an old-fashioned game which you will
be sure to enjoy. Divide the company into two
groups and blindfold one group. The blindfolded
children must then be seated so that there
is a vacant chair beside each of them. Then others
must quietly sit down, so that beside each
blindfolded child sits one who is not blindfolded.
A chord is played on the piano and then a familiar
tune, such as “Yankee Doodle.” All the children
who are not blindfolded must sing and the
blindfolded ones must guess from the voice who
is sitting beside them. Whoever guesses right is
allowed to remove the bandage from his eyes.
Of course in singing each one tries to disguise his
voice.</p>

<h2>HUNT THE RING</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Stand</span> in a circle and hold a cord whose ends
are joined together, having first slipped a ring
on the cord. Choose some child to stand in the
center of the circle. The ring is slipped from
one to another, always keeping it hidden by the
hands, and the one in the middle must catch hold
of the hands of whoever has the ring. If he
can catch a child with the ring really in his hands
then that one must go in the center of the circle.
Of course the ring must be slipped from one to
another very quickly.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>SLIP THE RULER</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is very much like “Hunt the Ring,” except
that instead of standing in a circle you must
sit down in a row. One child must stand in front
of the row, while the others pass a ruler from
hand to hand in regular order up and down the
line. He must try and catch the ruler, and whoever
is caught with it in his hands must exchange
places with the other.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>BEAST, BIRD OR FISH</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is a game in which you must think
quickly. The leader of this game says, “Beast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
bird or fish,” then quickly pointing to one child
calls, “Fish! one, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten!” While he is counting
ten the other must name some kind of a fish, and
if he fails the leader has another chance. If he
succeeds he becomes leader.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>SHOUTING PROVERBS</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is a game which makes plenty of noise.
Send one child from the room and choose some
proverb, such as “A stitch in time saves nine.”
Give each player one word of the proverb and
call the “outsider” in. When he gives the signal
you must each say your word, altogether. If
he doesn’t guess from the noise what the proverb
is, you must repeat it twice more for him.
If he can’t guess then, he must go out again, and
you choose another proverb.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>BEANS</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Divide</span> the children in two companies, standing
in line, facing each other (like a spelling match).
The leader of each line has a handful of beans,
and when the signal is given the beans are passed
down the line from one to the other. The last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
player places his in a bowl, and whichever side
has the most, wins, for beans that have been
dropped are not counted.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>WHAT IS MY THOUGHT LIKE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Probably</span> grandmother played this game when
she was your age, for it is very old. To begin the
game, the leader asks each child in turn, “What
is my thought like?” and each in turn mentions
some object, such as a rose, a book, an orange,
etc. Then the leader says, “I was thinking of
Ethel.” Turning to the first child he says, “You
said my thought was like a rose. Why is Ethel
like a rose?” The answer might be, “Because
she is pretty.”</p>

<p>The next is asked: “Why is she like an
orange?” “Because I am fond of her.”</p>

<p>So each in turn must give some reason why
Ethel is like the object he named.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>POST</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">To</span> play Post arrange the chairs in a large circle,
while one child, chosen for postman, stands
blindfolded in the center of the circle. Each of
the others must now take a name of some city
or town. When ready to begin the postman calls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“A letter is going from Washington to London,”
and the children who have chosen these names
must change places, while the postman tries to
catch one. Whoever is caught must be postman
and give up his place to the former postman.
If the postman calls, “All the letters are going,”
every one must change his seat, and there is a
general scramble, in which some one is sure to be
caught.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>CHARADES</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">These</span> are always a great deal of fun, for they
mean “dressing up,” and who doesn’t enjoy that.
Some good words for charades are car-pet, pilgrim-age,
tea-sing, in-dolent (inn-dough-lent)
and child-hood. Of course you will need mother’s
help when you play charades.</p>


<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2>HOW, WHEN AND WHERE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Send</span> one player from the room and then choose
some object, such as a flower. Call him in again
and let him try to guess what you have chosen.
So he must ask each player in turn, “How do you
like it?” The first may answer, “I like it pink.”
The next, “I like it fresh,” etc. The guesser
then asks each in turn, “When do you like it?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
and the others reply, “When I am going to a
party,” “When I am sick,” “When I am going
to make bread,” This last will be puzzling because
it means another kind of flour. If he is
not able to guess when he has asked all these questions,
he can go round once more with the question,
“Where do you like it?” Whoever “gives
it away” must be the one to go out.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>PEANUT GRAB</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> this game place a pile of peanuts on a table.
Now form in line and all march around it.
Each one, as he passes the pile of peanuts, takes
a handful, and when all have marched past they
can count to see who has been able to hold the
most in his hand.</p>


<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2>FEATHERS</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is a game in which you have to “pay attention,”
and perhaps you have played it at
school. You must all sit in a circle and let your
hands hang down from the wrists. The leader
of this game begins, “Cats have feathers, dogs
have feathers, rabbits have feathers, geese have
feathers.” The minute he names something that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
really has feathers, you must all raise your hands
and wave them. Whoever doesn’t do this must
pay a forfeit. As the leader must speak very,
very quickly, it is easy to be “caught napping.”</p>

<div class="tnote"><div class="center"><b>Transcriber’s Notes:</b></div>

<p>Obvious punctuation errors repaired. About a third of the way
through the book, the printer started using small-capitals on the
first word of each chapter. (Page 30—AN AFTERNOON IN HOLLAND)
To make the layout consistent, small-capitals have been added to the
initial chapters as well. As usual, small-capitals will appear as
ALL-CAPITALS in the plain text version.</p>

<p>Page 7, “you” changed to “your” (Now when your friends)</p>

<p>Pages 32-34, text uses “kimono” in the poem, but “kimona” twice in
the chapter text. Both were retained as printed.</p>

<p>Page 57, “inviations” changed to “invitations” (invitations right away)</p>
